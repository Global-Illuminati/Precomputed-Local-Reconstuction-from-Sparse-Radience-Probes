# Precomputed-Local-Reconstuction-from-Sparse-Radience-Probes


implementation of: https://users.aalto.fi/~silvena4/Projects/RTGI/index.html




## RealTime:

- [x] Render Lightmap:
- [x] Calculate GI :
- [x] Render Scene with GI:

## TODO:
- [ ] Add the cos factor again, precomputed normals wrong maybe?
- [ ] Make differnt probes have different radius so we can interpolate betweeen more probes.
- [ ] Verify correctness against pathtraced version
- [ ] optmize, optimize, optmize, must run smoothly
